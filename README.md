<p align="center">
  I'm a passionate and experienced developer who specializes in creating advanced Minecraft plugins. I work primarily with Java and have built a wide range of features for Minecraft servers using frameworks like Spigot, Paper, and Bukkit. Outside of Minecraft, I also build strong full-stack websites, Unity games, and database-driven systems.
